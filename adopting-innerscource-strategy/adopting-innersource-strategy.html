  <h1>Define InnerSource</h1>

  <h3>What is your definition of InnerSource?</h3>
  <p>Chances are you have heard or read something about InnerSource by now, but just knowing about InnerSource and
    knowing
    what InnerSource is can be harder to identify. In fact, our experience has shown that when asking people to explain
    what
    InnerSource is, we get many different answers, and some of these different mentalities come from leaders within the
    same
    organization.</p>

  <p>Problem: Everyone seems to have a slightly different idea of what InnerSource is. Having a clear definition within
    the
    same organization is vital to adopting an InnerSource culture within your organization.</p>

  <p>Think of this as a maze. Without a clear understanding and correct direction, it's easy for team members to get
    lost in
    their own direction of where to go.</p>
